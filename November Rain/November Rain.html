                <p>
                    When I look into your eyes
                    I can see a love restrained<br>
                    But darlin' when I hold you
                    Don't you know I feel the same<br>
                    Nothin' lasts forever
                    And we both know hearts can change<br>
                    And it's hard to hold a candle
                    In the cold November rain
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've been through this such a long long time
                    Just tryin' to kill the pain, oo yeah<br>
                    But love is always coming and love is always going
                    And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today,
                    Walking away<br>
                    If we could take the time
                    To lay it on the line
                    I could rest my head
                    Just knowin' that you were mine,
                    All mine<br>
                    So if you want to love me
                    Then darlin' don't refrain<br>
                    Or I'll just end up walkin'
                    In the cold November rain
                </p>
                <p>

                    Do you need some time on your own,
                    Do you need some time all alone<br>
                    Everybody needs some time
                    On their own,
                    Don't you know you need some time all alone<br>
                    I know it's hard to keep an open heart
                    When even friends seem out to harm you<br>
                    But if you could heal a broken heart
                    Wouldn't time be out to charm you<br>
                    Sometimes I need some time on my
                    Own,
                    Sometimes I need some time all alone<br>
                    Everybody needs some time
                    On their own,
                    Don't you know you need some time all alone
                </p>
                <p>

                    And when your fears subside
                    And shadows still remain, oh yeah<br>
                    I know that you can love me
                    When there's no one left to blame<br>
                    So never mind the darkness
                    We still can find a way<br>
                    'Cause nothin' lasts forever
                    Even cold November rain
                </p>
